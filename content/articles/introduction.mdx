1. Read-Heavy System
Use caching to make the reads faster.

2. High-Write Traffic
Use async workers to process the writes
Use databases powered by LSM-Trees

3. Single Point of Failure
Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms for critical components like databases.

4. High Availability
Use load balancing to ensure that requests go to healthy server instances.
Use database replication to improve durability and availability.

5. High Latency
Use a content delivery network to reduce latency

6. Handling Large Files
Use block storage and object storage to handle large files and complex data.

7. Monitoring and Alerting
Use a centralized logging system using something like the ELK stack.

8. Slower Database Queries
Use proper indexes to optimize queries.
Use sharding to scale the database horizontally.
